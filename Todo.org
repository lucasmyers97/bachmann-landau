** Plot
*** DONE New, more closely-spaced gridlines are created, and old gridlines fade out on zoom
    CLOSED: [2023-09-10 Sun 13:18]
**** Want gridlines to end up aligned with the $[-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]$ axes
***** If $n$ is the number of spaces (where $n$ must be even so that axes coincide with the gridlines) then the initial spacing will be $1 / n$. 
***** The new smaller viewport should then be of width $1 / n$, and $n$ new subspaces would live in the smaller viewport. 
***** If $n$ is the number of spaces (where $n$ must be even so that axes coincide with the gridlines) then that means the total number of gridlines between $-1$ and $1$ should be:
      \begin{equation}
      n^p
      \end{equation}
      when the screen is zoomed in or out, with $p$ some integer power (positive for more zoomed).
      Then the grid-spacing should be:
      \begin{equation}
      2 / n^p
      \end{equation}
      since our interval is $[-1, 1]$
      If the screen width is $w$, then the number of visible spaces is:
      \begin{equation}
      v = w / (2 / n^p) = n^p w / 2
      \end{equation}
      So if $w = 2$ for the start, and $p = 1$ then $v = n$.
      we want the $p$'s for which $v \approx n$.
      This gives:
      \begin{equation}
      p = \log_n(2 n / w) = 1 - \ln(w / 2) / \ln(n)
      \end{equation}
      This will be a non-integer, so we take the floor and the ceil to get the two limits.
      The smaller one of these will give the larger viewport width, which is given by
      \begin{equation}
      2 n / n^{p} = 2 / n^{p - 1} 
      \end{equation}
      Again, if $w$ is slightly larger than $2$, then $p < 1$ by a bit.
      Taking the floor gives $p = 0$ which gives a viewport width of $2n$.
**** Should have initial axes and n_grid_spaces in there
*** DONE Pinch to zoom on touchscreen
    CLOSED: [2023-09-14 Thu 22:51]
*** DONE Fix bug with mobile Firefox browser where canvas doesn't show up
    CLOSED: [2023-09-11 Mon 22:04]
**** Seemed to go away next time I tried it, not sure what the deal was
*** TODO Get rid of zoom box, display zoom somewhere else
*** TODO Make legend for different circles

** App
*** TODO Add dropdown to select which Bachmann-Landau notation
*** TODO Add explanation with GIFS (can just screenrecord from phone)
